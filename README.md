"I really couldn't make it any cheaper cause in retrospect I'm cranking out a Video Guide of a Kali Linux tool once every two weeks, a Monthly Newsletter in Newspaper Tabloid theme format, a Member Wall to maintain
featuring an A.I Generated cartoon of EVERY MEMBER hanging out with the 👽"Gurus"👽
, and a Blog to write not to mention all the downloadable Content! The
price of a case of brew seemed fair enough
to me in return for Unlimited Access!!!

"HEY! Don't forget to mention the downloadable content!" - Willy
